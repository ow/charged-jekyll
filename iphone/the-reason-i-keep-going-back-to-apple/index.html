          <p>Over the last few months I&rsquo;ve complained a lot about what Apple is doing – some of the moves it&rsquo;s making have been frustrating, like dropping the headphone jack, the lack of any progress on OS X and in general how poor iCloud is. The media loves to portray Apple as always right, but as a customer, it doesn&rsquo;t always feel that way.</p>

<p>I started considering switching from the iPhone and Apple Watch to something else, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/7/13207382/google-pixel-xl-camera-photography-samples">like Google&rsquo;s interesting new Pixel phone</a>, especially with that amazing camera. But today, I had a realization about why I stick with Apple&rsquo;s products: the customer experience really is a class above everyone else in the game.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had an iPhone 6s essentially since it came out, but recently it started developing some strange issues. First, the loudspeaker became distorted so you couldn&rsquo;t clearly hear anything at all. Annoying, but not the end of the world.</p>

<p>Then, after iOS 10 came out, I noticed my battery life went off a cliff. Not slightly-less-but-managable, but instead needing to hang off a charger because I&rsquo;d lose 25% just opening Slack for a few minutes. It was pretty bad, and I blamed software at first, but realized something else might be going wrong.</p>

<p>So, I booked a Genius appointment, like I have many times before, to see if something was really wrong. </p>

<p>At the appointment, I described the problem and we ran through a series of diagnostics on the phone automatically. It was, conclusively, screwed – the speaker alone warranted an entire replacement, but the battery issues were caused by a logic board problem.</p>

<p>Apple replaced it on the spot. No questions, accusation, argument or begging, I just got a new phone five minutes after walking in. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/proof.png"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how this experience flies in the face of every other type of customer service interaction we&rsquo;re used to. Usually, when something goes wrong your default setting is to go in expecting a fight, or at least resistance to your problem. </p>

<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s probably your fault, and retailers love to point that out. If they finally admit fault, they&rsquo;ll usually send it off for repairs rather than actually just give you a new one or fix it on the spot.</p>

<p>In that world, Apple is starkly the opposite. Something&rsquo;s wrong? Great, here&rsquo;s a better phone for free. Broken screen? Perfect, it&rsquo;ll be fixed within an hour for a nominal fee.</p>

<p>The entire Genius system is so good, that I realized this level of service is the major reason I&rsquo;m still buying Apple products: I know if something goes wrong with my MacBook, iPhone or Watch, that I&rsquo;ll be taken care of, and nobody&rsquo;s going to accuse me of doing something wrong or make me suffer because of the issue.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had this experience consistently with Apple&rsquo;s customer care, who are happy to just help you get going again, rather than run you around, and it&rsquo;s refreshing. </p>

<p>No other phone maker, carrier or even laptop maker does this, and it&rsquo;s easy to forget that while we&rsquo;re distracted about whether or not the iPhone 7 is the best phone ever – I just don&rsquo;t care anymore, as long as I know I can actually get help when I need it. With the Pixel, <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/04/googles-247-live-support-for-the-pixel-phones-comes-complete-with-screen-sharing/">Google seems to be trying</a>, but time will tell whether that actually matters.</p>

<p>Sure, your reaction to this post might be &ldquo;oh, but Apple&rsquo;s products are overpriced&rdquo; but when I&rsquo;ve factored in that I&rsquo;ve received four full phone replacements over the years as well as a Mac replacement, no questions asked, it&rsquo;s worth every dollar. </p>

<p>That peace of mind, and great service, is worth whatever premium you might think is attached to the company&rsquo;s products. Being treated like a human, rather than just another complaining asshole, is refreshing.</p>

<p>Some of Apple&rsquo;s product decisions are frustrating, yes, but I&rsquo;ll be a loyal customer long-term, provided Apple&rsquo;s stores and support systems continue to exist. Nobody else can offer that level of service, nor have they come close thus far. </p>
