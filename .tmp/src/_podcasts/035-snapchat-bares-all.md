How is it February already? Well, we're here for you – this week on the podcast we get down into the dirt on these topics:

- [Snapchat's S1 filing is official](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564408/000119312517029199/d270216ds1.htm)
- [Facebook is scared of being kicked out of the app store, so it's been intentionally crashing your app to test your loyalty](http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/4/10708590/facebook-google-android-app-crash-tests)
- [Oculus lost a $500 million lawsuit for copying code](http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/1/14474198/oculus-lawsuit-verdict)
- [Slack's moving into the enterprise, and could it make it into the Fourtune 500?](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/slack-enterprise-grid/)
- [This insanely addictive game is like a Silicon Valley simulator](http://thefounder.biz)

How about a book club this week? We've got you: John recommends ["Why Nations Fail"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058Z4NR8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) which examines what elements lead countries to fall apart, or just fail in general. Apparently it's a great, but heavy read.
