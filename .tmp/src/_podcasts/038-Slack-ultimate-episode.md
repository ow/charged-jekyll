Last month, [Owen wrote a post taking down Snapchat](https://medium.com/charged-tech/why-im-leaving-snapchat-and-so-are-all-your-friends-dd241f0cd14) for its lack of any "sticky" factors and how it was bleeding users to Instagram Stories – an almost perfect clone. 

On this podcast, [Taylor Lorenz](https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz), a technology journalist and avid Snapchat fan joins us to talk about Snap, and why she thinks Owen is wrong. That part of the discussion at 35 minutes in! 

Here's the links to the rest of interesting discussion:
