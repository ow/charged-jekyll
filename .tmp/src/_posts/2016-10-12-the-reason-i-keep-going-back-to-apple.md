description: I finally figured out why I keep buying Apple products, and it's not neccessarily because they're better, but because the company's support is so damn good.
---
Over the last few months I've complained a lot about what Apple is doing – some of the moves it's making have been frustrating, like dropping the headphone jack, the lack of any progress on OS X and in general how poor iCloud is. The media loves to portray Apple as always right, but as a customer, it doesn't always feel that way.
 
I started considering switching from the iPhone and Apple Watch to something else, [like Google's interesting new Pixel phone](http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/7/13207382/google-pixel-xl-camera-photography-samples), especially with that amazing camera. But today, I had a realization about why I stick with Apple's products: the customer experience really is a class above everyone else in the game.

I've had an iPhone 6s essentially since it came out, but recently it started developing some strange issues. First, the loudspeaker became distorted so you couldn't clearly hear anything at all. Annoying, but not the end of the world.

Then, after iOS 10 came out, I noticed my battery life went off a cliff. Not slightly-less-but-managable, but instead needing to hang off a charger because I'd lose 25% just opening Slack for a few minutes. It was pretty bad, and I blamed software at first, but realized something else might be going wrong.

So, I booked a Genius appointment, like I have many times before, to see if something was really wrong. 

At the appointment, I described the problem and we ran through a series of diagnostics on the phone automatically. It was, conclusively, screwed – the speaker alone warranted an entire replacement, but the battery issues were caused by a logic board problem.

Apple replaced it on the spot. No questions, accusation, argument or begging, I just got a new phone five minutes after walking in.

It's amazing how this experience flies in the face of every other type of customer service interaction we're used to. Usually, when something goes wrong your default setting is to go in expecting a fight, or at least resistance to your problem. 

Obviously, it's probably your fault, and retailers love to point that out. If they finally admit fault, they'll usually send it off for repairs rather than actually just give you a new one or fix it on the spot.

In that world, Apple is starkly the opposite. Something's wrong? Great, here's a better phone for free. Broken screen? Perfect, it'll be fixed within an hour for a nominal fee.

The entire Genius system is so good, that I realized this level of service is the major reason I'm still buying Apple products: I know if something goes wrong with my MacBook, iPhone or Watch, that I'll be taken care of, and nobody's going to accuse me of doing something wrong or make me suffer because of the issue.

I've had this experience consistently with Apple's customer care, who are happy to just help you get going again, rather than run you around, and it's refreshing. 

No other phone maker, carrier or even laptop maker does this, and it's easy to forget that while we're distracted about whether or not the iPhone 7 is the best phone ever – I just don't care anymore, as long as I know I can actually get help when I need it. With the Pixel, [Google seems to be trying](http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/04/googles-247-live-support-for-the-pixel-phones-comes-complete-with-screen-sharing/), but time will tell whether that actually matters.

Sure, your reaction to this post might be "oh, but Apple's products are overpriced" but when I've factored in that I've received four full phone replacements over the years as well as a Mac replacement, no questions asked, it's worth every dollar. 

That peace of mind, and great service, is worth whatever premium you might think is attached to the company's products. Being treated like a human, rather than just another complaining asshole, is refreshing.

Some of Apple's product decisions are frustrating, yes, but I'll be a loyal customer long-term, provided Apple's stores and support systems continue to exist. Nobody else can offer that level of service, nor have they come close thus far.
