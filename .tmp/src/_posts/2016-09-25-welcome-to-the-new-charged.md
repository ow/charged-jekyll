Hello and welcome to the new Charged website! It's incredibly long overdue, and it's finally here.

This is the first in a series of upgrades to Charged â€“ the biggest since I started writing the newsletter in 2014. Now we're running the podcast, newsletter and a blog on the same platform making it much less confusing.

The tech underneath means it's blazing-fast and you're able to come to a single place to get everything. As this has grown beyond just a newsletter it was time to invest in modernizing everything, rather than just continuing to hack it all together.

In the near future we'll be re-launching the newsletter format with a modern framework too, but in the meantime I'll be blogging here more frequently and hope that this will become a place you refer back to so you can keep up with everything.

It's kind of hard to believe that the tiny newsletter I started two years ago has grown to more than 9,000 subscribers and a podcast that's had over 70,000 unique listens. Onward, to the next milestone!

Thanks for your support and continuing to read,
Owen
