          <p>While we weren&rsquo;t watching, over the last two years the web has quickly begun swallowing the desktop environment whole. If you&rsquo;re an average user, you probably have a few desktop apps that you use daily without even realizing they&rsquo;re built using web technology.</p>

<p>The idea of major applications on your desktop, that you use every day, being entirely web-based was pretty far-fetched a few years ago — many people were skeptical that the web could ever supercede desktop apps in both performance, or usability.</p>

<p>Now, in 2017, many web-based desktop apps are fantastic — and we&rsquo;re using them daily, often without even knowing. Last week, I realized that most of the applications I use every day are web-based, with the exception of a handful of heavier tools like Photoshop and Audition.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Realized the majority of the apps I use every day are Electron. The web is swallowing the desktop. <a href="https://t.co/t27L5U9roo">pic.twitter.com/t27L5U9roo</a></p>&mdash; Owen ⚡️ (@ow) <a href="https://twitter.com/ow/status/842095992753295361">March 15, 2017</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, <a href="https://electron.atom.io/blog/2015/04/23/electron">which was built originally as a way for GitHub to release its Atom code editor across platforms</a>, only hit the world in 2015 for the first time, but it&rsquo;s already quickly changing the types of apps we use daily.  </p>

<p>Every type of app you use can eventually become an Electron app, and it&rsquo;s happening fast: I&rsquo;ve converted to Nylas for email, Slack for chat, Hyper for my terminal, Visual Studio Code for development and a whole lot more. Even outside of Electron, the web is creeping in everywhere: Spotify&rsquo;s desktop app is built with JavaScript too. </p>

<p>The reason for this rapid change is simply that an Electron app is easier to maintain and develop, allows you to target multiple platforms <em>and</em> lets your team use modern build pipelines to write once and truly run everywhere. As a result, they tend to be more actively maintained, and see more updates than the competition. </p>

<h3 class="pull"><a href="https://twitter.com/SteveStreza/status/842268992756563968">“Look i want native apps to not suck but apple doesn&rsquo;t give a shit, ms barely gives a shit, and app devs absolutely do not give a shit”</a></h3>

<p>A lot of people highlight that Electron apps tend to use more memory than others, but that claim tends to be overblown, or just simply out-dated. Nylas&rsquo; desktop email app uses just 80MB of Memory, while Slack only uses 166MB — developers might loudly complain that&rsquo;s too much, but given modern machines tend to have more than 8GB of RAM onboard, what does it matter?</p>

<p><a href="https://slack.engineering/reducing-slacks-memory-footprint-4480fec7e8eb#.3wedumcyc">Companies like Slack are addressing that head-on</a>. A post this month said that the company is already addressing memory concerns (most of which happen to outlying users that are signed into many teams) and that it&rsquo;s entirely resolvable — it just takes smart decisions.</p>

<p>Another popular complaint is that Electron-based apps don&rsquo;t look and feel as good as their native counterparts. That might be true for some, but Nylas Mail looks just as good as Apple&rsquo;s own default mail client, and Slack blends just like everything else.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/nylas.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The thing is, most users can&rsquo;t even tell they&rsquo;re using a &ldquo;web app&rdquo; anymore. In Electron&rsquo;s early days, it&rsquo;s true that they tended to be slower, or stick out like a sore thumb, but now I generally prefer them for how well they feel like a real native app.</p>

<p>Why should a user even give a shit what&rsquo;s underneath, as long as they can get their work done? And best of all, updates keep getting delivered, and they basically have no idea. </p>

<p>There are <a href="http://sircmpwn.github.io/2016/11/24/Electron-considered-harmful.html"><em>a lot</em> of Electron haters</a> out there, and any time you bring it up on Twitter you&rsquo;re sure to be eaten alive, but the justifications for not using Electron are dated and just plain wrong: the reality is that people are writing useful software with Electron and <strong>actually ship shit.</strong></p>

<p><h3 class="pull"><a href="https://twitter.com/_tobycox/status/842152371274702848">“Cue loads of native devs saying &ldquo;web apps suck&rdquo; and millions of real users happily not giving a fuck what they&rsquo;re written in.”</a></h3></p>

<p>Best of all, many of these Electron-based apps have actually built a business model! Nylas, which is 100% Electron, is growing an entire platform despite only having an Electron app, which might have been a sin in the past — and people are paying for it!</p>

<p>Nylas&rsquo; founder, Michael Grinich <a href="https://twitter.com/grinich/status/842243239398723584">says</a> the company took a huge, risky bet on choosing Electron a few years ago — I&rsquo;m sure people thought they were crazy — but that it&rsquo;s paying off.</p>

<p>The biggest benefit of Electron, for me, has been proven through my switch to Windows. The majority of the apps I use and love every day exist on both platforms thanks to the technology, and operate exactly the same all while blending in with the operating system. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet  tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apps are winning! No wait! The browser is winning! 🤔 <a href="https://t.co/lpazY5EBXG">pic.twitter.com/lpazY5EBXG</a></p>&mdash; Koen Bok (@koenbok) <a href="https://twitter.com/koenbok/status/816244815109230592">January 3, 2017</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The best part about this transition is end-users basically haven&rsquo;t noticed. Millions of people are happily using Slack every day, and it helps them get their job done. </p>

<p>An example of how a business model can be disrupted by Electron is already underway. Sketch&rsquo;s design tool that hundreds of thousands of designers use famously only works on a Mac — <a href="https://www.google.nl/search?q=sketch+windows&amp;oq=sketch+windows&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1448j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">there are hundreds of people looking for alternatives on Google</a>, and as far as anyone can tell, it&rsquo;s an <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/support/faq/02-general/5-windows.html">intentional ommission</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sketch relies on a lot of technology that is exclusive to OS X and the fact that no other OS provide a clear business model for software development, we’re not considering supporting it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great, but there are thousands of Windows designers out there too&hellip; so what do they use? Is there not a paid market for them to use too? </p>

<p>Well, as it turns out, <a href="figma.com">Figma</a>, a new entrant in the market that offers a web-based offering <em>also</em> has an Electron app, and it can directly import Sketch files too. </p>

<p>In my mind, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the tool that works everywhere eventually beats out the tool that&rsquo;s restricted to slow releases on a single platform — oh, and <a href="http://releases.figma.com/">Figma literally ships a platform update every other week.</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still early days, but Electron is eating the desktop alive. There&rsquo;s no way to stop it, and developers planning a native app should seriously ask themselves: should I learn to write HTML instead, and use Electron so I can target users on any platform? </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear that the answer is yes, and that the true native app is a dying breed.</p>
