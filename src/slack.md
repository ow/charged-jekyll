Hey there! You've probably found this from the Charged Podcast or newsletter? Well, you're in the right place.

We're building a community of the smartest people in technology – yourself included – and are excited you want to join us! Right now, we're 250 of the smartest people from the coolest startups out there, but we want you too.

Soon, we're going to start charging a small yearly fee to be a part of this helpful, growing community, but for the next two weeks we're inviting you to join us before that launches. Jump on in, and hang out with John and Owen, as well as the wider community.

We'd love to add your voice, [so click right here and join us!](http://charged-podcast.herokuapp.com/) Be quick, because this page will be replaced with the paid sign up soon, and this is a great way to try it out before then.
