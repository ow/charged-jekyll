Curated by Owen Williams, Charged is a weekly newsletter designed to save you time and get you up to date, without the need to keep up with noisy tech sites.

It started as a fun side project in 2014, and grew more than 200% every year since then from little more than word of mouth. Now, Charged is a newsletter and a podcast.

Join more than 9,000 subscribers who get noise-free tech news delivered to their inbox every weekend. We round up the best technology stories, long reads and top startups.

We're all about making technology meaningful for everyone, with subscribers from many backgrounds: venture capitalists, high school teachers, mechanics, accountants, software engineers, designers and more.

If you're just joining us, I hope you find great value in Charged. I created this newsletter because I was seeking something better for digesting the noisy technology world, and I hope it's useful to you!

â€” Owen
