If you can’t make it, we also have a cyberspace hangout now – in Slack. If you want to join, just head here and type in your email address. We’re not sharing this beyond the podcast for now, so it’s a small community, but we’d love to chat!

- Google Duo, the company’s new video calling app
  - Google Hangouts isn’t dead… it’s just for enterprise now
