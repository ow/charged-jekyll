*Here's a copy of the email I sent out to subscribers in late November. Charged newsletter will be back – really soon – but I wanted to take a break to reflect, rebuild and make sure it's better than ever.*

Hey there, and happy Thanksgiving!

If you've been around for a while you'll know what Charged newsletter has been a thing for over two years at this point. Over that time I've sent more than 100 newsletters and more than 10,000 of you have joined the community.

It's been an incredible journey, since I mostly had just expected a few people to sign up to my silly side project, and it's grown bigger than I ever expected.

Because I'm sending this every week - and recording the podcast - I haven't had the time I wanted to dedicate to make this newletter better or up to the standard I'd expect for myself. A few weeks ago we launched new Charged branding for both the newsletter and podcast, but it did't make it here yet – and it's long overdue.

So, for the next few weeks the newsletter is going to take a break to reassess where we're at, and to rebuild the template to be properly responsive, and in line with our new style. It'll definitely come back, but it'll look very different, work properly and be much easier to read.

Want a sneak peek? Here's what we're working on:

If you want to chat about anything feel free to just reply to this email! I'd love to hear from you – otherwise, enjoy the podcast in the meantime, until this comes back.

Thanks so much for subscribing, and reading this newsletter. It means a lot - and it's incredible to me that the community has grown so much.

See you soon,<br>
Owen
