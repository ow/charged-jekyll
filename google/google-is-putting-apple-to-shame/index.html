          <p>The narrative of Apple vs Google has always been a persistent one: Apple is great at hardware and software that fits together perfectly, and Google was never particularly good at either of those.</p>

<p>Today, Google held a &ldquo;Pixel&rdquo; event to unveil its new self-designed and self-built hardware: a phone, a router and, most intriguingly, a home assistant.</p>

<p>The home assistant, <a href="https://madeby.google.com/home/">aptly named &lsquo;Google Home&rsquo;</a> is a small speaker that lives in your house and can respond – from basically anywhere – to any question you might have for it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/ghome.jpg"></p>

<p>That new speaker is powered by a piece of software called Google Assistant. It&rsquo;s the company&rsquo;s first push into what it calls &#39;personalized search&rsquo; – or a Google that knows about you intimately and can help based on the context it has from your email, search habits or any other data it has access to.</p>

<p><a href="http://assistant.google.com/">Google Assistant</a> is interesting because it&rsquo;s the culmination of years of work from the company to build the perfect ecosystem for knowing the right things about you.</p>

<p>Google knows what you&rsquo;re doing, where you&rsquo;re going, how you spend most of your time and what you&rsquo;ll probably do next – just because you use its services every day. You might call that creepy, but I believe there&rsquo;s a magic line where that&rsquo;s actually incredibly useful and Google&rsquo;s finally found it.</p>

<p>Assistant can do things like pull up your agenda for the day, book you a table or, most importantly, know the difference between a question and you continuing the conversation.</p>

<div class="videoWrapper">
<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPfQMVf4vwQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>If you ask Assistant &ldquo;How long will it take to get from Downtown Chicago to home?&rdquo; then follow up with &ldquo;what restaurants are there?&rdquo; it&rsquo;ll know exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about – a question that Siri would&rsquo;ve fallen over on already.</p>

<p>Siri, by comparison to what Google showed today, looks like a glorified egg timer. Because Apple has chosen the route of absolute privacy, and can&rsquo;t process any of your data or learn from it, the company remains in the dark about what you want, or when you&rsquo;ll need it. Siri is, in effect, a toy.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me here, Siri is an incredible innovation and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/apples-differential-privacy-collecting-data/">Apple has done some very interesting things</a> to help it learn despite the restrictions it placed on itself, but the company is at a massive disadvantage: it&rsquo;s flying blind.</p>

<p>By putting Assistant in the home with the speaker, Google has taken it to the next level. Now you&rsquo;re able to intimately interact with it on a daily basis, asking for simple information, receiving reminders about appointments or flights – directly pulled from your inbox by the way – without much effort.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/assist.jpg"></p>

<p>Through learning about you, Google has built the ultimate way to actually build a useful, contextual search engine. There&rsquo;s almost no comparison.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/01/apple-shows-off-the-first-siri-powered-apps-arriving-in-ios-10/">Apple&rsquo;s integration of apps into Siri is cute</a>, and long overdue, but pales in comparison to the usefulness of having an entire search engine plugged in.</p>

<p>Google&rsquo;s adaption of its Assistant inside its new messaging service <a href="http://allo.google.com">Allo</a> is also intriguing: what if you could interact collaboratively with an AI-helper? To book a table, you&rsquo;re able to ask Assistant for help, then discuss it amongst yourselves, then pull it back in to finish setting the appointment up.</p>

<p>The experience is so magic you couldn&rsquo;t dream of Apple pulling it off. iMessage works well enough, but Apple&rsquo;s imagination – and speed – is nothing to be envious off. Siri in iMessage would be useful, if it could actually figure out what was going on in the first place.</p>

<p>As Apple has focused on privacy as a selling point – and rightly so, given the battle it fought with the FBI – Google has taken the opposite approach, putting the data it has on you to work.</p>

<p>It risked that being perceived as creepy, for years, but I think it&rsquo;s finally paid off with the manifestation of this Assistant that adjusts for your preferences, not just a boiler-plate voice assistant that acts the same for everyone else.</p>

<p>Now that Google is officially playing in the hardware game, it&rsquo;s going to be everywhere from your car to your house and that&rsquo;s a big deal. Now its Assistant can be a persistent helper in your life, so for the first time, all those things it knows about is going to be put to work – and not for advertising.</p>
